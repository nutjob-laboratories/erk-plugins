 - [Dice Roller](https://github.com/nutjob-laboratories/erk-plugins/raw/master/DiceRoller.perk) - This plugin adds a new command: `/roll`, which allows you to simulate dice rolls for dice of various types.
 - [Documentation Plugins](https://github.com/nutjob-laboratories/erk-plugins/raw/master/DocumentationExamples.perk) -  These are the plugins described in the [**Ərk** plugin documentation](https://github.com/nutjob-laboratories/erk/blob/master/documentation/Erk_Plugin_Guide.pdf).

 - [Nickname Grabber](https://github.com/nutjob-laboratories/erk-plugins/raw/master/NickGrabber.perk) - Lost your nickname? This plugin adds a new command: `/grab`. Entering the command will cause **Ərk** to ask you the nickname you'd like to reclaim; **Ərk** will then try to change your nickname to the desired one at random intervals until the desired nickname is grabbed. This plugin is installed by default with every new **Ərk** install.
