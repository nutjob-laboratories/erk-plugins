This repository contains plugins for the [Ərk IRC client](https://github.com/nutjob-laboratories/erk).

The "Nick Grabber" plugin can be found in the "grab" directory. To install it, copy the entire directory into your plugins directory (on Linux, this would be `~/.erk/plugins`) and restart Ərk.

[`skeleton.py`](https://github.com/nutjob-laboratories/erk-plugins/blob/master/skeleton.py) is a basic plugin skeleton, with all plugin events. It will do nothing if loaded as is :-)
